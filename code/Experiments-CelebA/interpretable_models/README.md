Code for Figure 3. and Figure 10. of https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01355.pdf

Unconstrained/FairALM predict label attractiveness while controlling gender. The heatmaps of Unconstrained model overlaps with gender classification task indicating gender leak. FairALM consistently picks non-gender revealing features of the face. Interestingly, these regions are on the left side in accord with psychological studies that the Faceâ€™s left side is more attractive.
