### Identifying Unfair Labels in CelebA dataset.

Code for Table 1. of https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01355.pdf


We report the DEO measure for the Unconstrained model (U) and FairALM model (F).Using a 3-layers ReLU network, we determine the labels in CelebA dataset that are biased with respect to gender and the attribute young. Labels with a precision of at least 70% and a DEO of at least 4% on the unconstrained model are reported here.
